This is the first project on The Odin Project right after I completed the CSS Flexbox module. It was very challenging and I commited to completing it. Took me almost two days. I hope to look back on this to see how far iv'e come in my journey and through earning my CS degree at SNHU. As I am writing this, 2 days seems like a lot, however, I learned a lot and I learned how to perservere at writing code and solving code problems. I am proud that I did not give up. There are a few things I may come back to tweak (positining wise and font type). I consider myself done with this project and am moving on in the foundations course.
