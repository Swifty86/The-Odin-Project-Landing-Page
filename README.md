This is the first project on The Odin Project right after I completed the CSS Flexbox module. It was very challenging and I commited to completing it. Took me almost two days. I hope to look back on this to see how far iv'e come in my journey and through earning my CS degree at SNHU. As I am writing this, 2 days seems like a lot, however, I learned a lot and I learned how to perservere at writing code and solving code problems. I am proud that I did not give up. There are a few things I may come back to tweak (positining wise and font type). I consider myself done with this project and am moving on in the foundations course.


08/11/2022: I finished it. All I had to do was use my new skills I learned from Kenzie Academy to see that I didn't need that extra width on the call to action container. I enrolled at Kenzie Academy in in 2022 and I am learning Full Stack web development using the MERN stack. It was nice to come back and look at this 6 months later and having known so much more it was nice to see how far I have come as a web developer.
